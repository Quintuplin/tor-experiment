# Anonymity of Network Traffic Using Tor

## Background
Today we live in a world where the Internet is accessible from almost anything that we have in our possession. However as Internet continues to become more expansive and accessible, the attacks on people using the Internet by spying on and stealing their information also increases. Nowadays we never know who may be in between you and your friend when sending text messages. How is this problem being solved in today's world? Well if there was no possible solution, I would not be writing this thesis right now. Let us take a deep dive into this solution, known as Tor.

Tor, which stands for The Onion Router, is a software that protects you from people on the Internet who are trying to spy on you. Tor has a network of routers that keeps your identity hidden by moving your traffic across its network before your traffic is sent to its destination. In this way, when your traffic reaches the final destination, someone spying on you would not know who actually sent that specific data packet. Even the site which is your destination would not know from where the traffic is coming from. In this way, people who use Tor are able to browse the Internet anonymously without ever revealing their location.

Who actually uses Tor? Let us first take look back at the history of Tor when it was first created. Tor was originally developed by the US military for the purpose of providing some kind of cloaking mechanism of the identity of government personnel when they worked online[1]. Mainly funded by the Office of Naval Research and DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), the main goal of creating Tor was to provide anonymity for military and intelligence operations that require the use of public communication infrastructure and/or databases[1]. This was their primary objective, and perhaps the only one. The developers of Tor knew that their software would be able to be used by other people for other reasons beyond their control. People would be able to use Tor to commit crimes all while cloaking their tracks. Even while knowing this, the development of Tor continued and was marketed for everyone to use. Why would
